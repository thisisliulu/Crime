# Data
## Technical description
In our project, we leverage data sourced from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Crime Data Explorer (accessible at https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/downloads), curated by Xinran She. Our focus is on analyzing the causes of arrests categorized by crime, with an emphasis on distinguishing between adult and juvenile arrests. To this end, we utilize three datasets: "Reported Number of Adult Arrests by Crime," "Reported Number of Juvenile Arrests by Crime," and "Hate Crime 2022". These records are reliable because only data from agencies that provided arrest records for 12 months of the year can be included. Meanwhile, they are in CSV format, which can be directly imported and read in R, offering ease of access and compatibility for our subsequent data visualization efforts.

### Reported Number of Adult Arrests by Crime
This dataset comprises data on the monthly count of adult arrests for a range of offenses, as reported by cooperating law enforcement agencies, spanning 1995 to 2016. The file was last modified in 2017 and is now completed. The dataset includes 644 rows and 47 columns. Each row of the data represents an offense reason based on a specific year, and the columns decompose the count of the arrested adults by age, race, and sex. The age range of offenders covered by this form is 18-65 years old. From the website, agencies might not provide race information, but age and sex should be clearly reported. So, some of the missing gender information may affect the subsequent visualization and analysis.

### Reported Number of Juvenile Arrests by Crime
Similar to 2.1-1, this dataset records the monthly count of juvenile arrests for different offenses, as reported by participating law enforcement agencies from 1995 to 2016. The file was last modified in 2017 and is now completed. The dataset includes 690 rows and 27 columns. Each row of the data represents an offense reason based on a specific year, and the columns decompose the count of the arrested adults by age, race, and sex. The age range of offenders covered by this form is 9-17 years old. The potential problem with the data is the same as 2.1-1 due to the insufficiency of race information.

### Hate Crime 2022
The hate crime dataset compiles annual data from 1991 to 2022, last updated in 2023, encompassing details on incidents, offenses, and involved individuals - both victims and offenders - in crimes driven by the perpetrator's bias towards the victim's race, gender, gender identity, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or ethnicity. Due to the extensive size of the original file, our analysis is concentrated on the data from 2022. This dataset segment contains 11,643 rows and 28 columns, each representing an individual incident and providing comprehensive incident details, including geographical location, numbers of victims and offenders, and the nature of the bias involved. A challenge presented by this dataset is its considerable size and the abundance of categorical data it contains. To effectively glean insights, engaging in data manipulation, compiling, and analyzing aggregate information is necessary.

## Research plan

## Missing value analysis
### First load our dataset:
```{r}
arrest_juvenile = read.csv("preprocessing/arrests_national_juvenile.csv")
arrest_adults = read.csv("preprocessing/arrests_national_adults.csv")
hate_crime22 = read.csv("preprocessing/hate_crime_2022.csv")
```
### Use aggregated missing patterns to check missing values in each dataset:
**Arrest_juvenile**
```{r}
#| fig-width: 50
#| fig-height: 20
#| out-width: 80%
library(redav)
library(ggplot2)
plot_missing(arrest_juvenile, percent = FALSE)+
  theme_bw(5)
```
The column "state_abbr" (state abbreviation)is completely missing. Unfortunately, we couldn't find other datasets which perfectly make up for the lack of state abbreviation. Since our main goal is not about discovering arrest crimes in states, we decide to drop "state_abbr" column. We have several missing values in "american_indian" and "asian_pacific_islander", which are more likely to be missing due to "not all agencies report race and/or ethnicity for arrests" from the FBI. We also have missing values in "f_0_9", f_0_12", "m_0_9", "f_13_14", "f_15", "m_10_12", "f_16" in decreasing order. Even though "all agencies must report age and sex", it is hard to implement in reality, and some agencies might not consistently report data which lead to missing values. Since missing values are not correlated with other variables and take up only a small percent, we would drop rows with missing values.

**Arrest_adults**
```{r}
#| fig-width: 70
#| fig-height: 20
#| out-width: 80%
plot_missing(arrest_adults, percent = FALSE)+
  theme_bw(5)
```

Similarly, the column "state_abbr" (state abbreviation)is completely missing. This time, we have fewer columns with missing values, only "f_60_64", f_65_p", "f_55_59" in decreasing order. In other words, we can see missing values are concentrated in females aged between 55 to 65+. The interesting pattern might caused by certain oversight when reporting elderly women in the agencies. Since missing values are not correlated with other variables and take up only a small percent, we would drop rows with missing values.

**Hate Crime**
```{r}
#| fig-width: 60
#| fig-height: 20
#| out-width: 80%
plot_missing(hate_crime22, percent = FALSE)+
  theme_bw(5)
```

We have equal number of missing values in "adult_offender_count" and "juvenile_offender_count". They are correlated because in each hate crime incident, agencies either report all the offenders, or they fail to report. The number of missing value of "juvenile_victim_count" is slightly higher than "adult_victim_count". One of the possible explanation is that the agencies are more likely to protect the privacy of juvenile that they choose not to report in the reality. We also have missing values in "total_individual_victims", given "total_individual_victims" is likely correlated with "juvenile_victim_count" and  "adult_victim_count". Since for **Hate Crime**, we are more interested in the "location, offender race and bias type" instead of the number of offenders and victims, we could subset the dataset to drop the columns with missing values.
